# Personal Bio Site  
### Description  
This project is the first stage of a personal bio site. I used hard-coded HTML to form a nav bar with fake links, a list of sample (but not yet accurate) technologies, and a div for the project cards. I then built an array of fake projects in my JavaScript. I looped over that array, testing on each iteration to see if the `available` key tested as true. If so, the string-builder function printed that product's card.
